#**Stock_Analysis**
## Project Overview
 The purpose of this analysis was to look at multiple stock qoutes over a two year range to determing if we could find which companies showed the best upward trends for our client to make an informed decision. We would utilize the stock prices for 12 companies over a two year period, this would include the clients initial stock pick for Daqo holdings(DQ). 
  ## Analysis Process  
     To find out which company had the best returns for each of the two years we utilzed data from 12 different companies for the fiscal years of 2017 and 2018. We made sure to include the daily total volume for each account, the stocks opening price, high for the day, and the closing price.
