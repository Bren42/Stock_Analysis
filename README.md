#**Stock_Analysis**
## Project Overview
 The purpose of this analysis was to look at multiple stock qoutes over a two year range to determing if we could find which companies showed the best upward trends for our client to make an informed decision. We would utilize the stock prices for 12 companies over a two year period, this would include the clients initial stock pick for Daqo holdings(DQ). 
  ## Analysis Process  
   To find out which company had the best returns for each of the two years we utilzed data from 12 different companies for the fiscal years of 2017 and 2018. We made sure to include the daily total volume for each account, the stocks opening price, high for the day, and the closing price. 
    ### Results
       Looking through the years 2017 and 2018 we see a couple different patterns.
       ## 2017 Results

 As we can see in 2017 everyone but TERP had a year of positive returns. However there were four companies that stood well ahead of the rest in overall percentage of return. DQ, SEDG, ENPH, and FSLR all ended the year with over a 100% return on investment. 
       
  ## 2018 Results

          In 2018 we saw a very different picture, most of our companies saw a loss on their stock price that year. ENPH and RUN however both showed significant positive returns for this year.
       ## Overall results
          Based on the outcomes of each year, and when looking at each stock in the cumulative, ENPH would be your best stock to pick based on data and other factors presented to us. It was one of only two companies that showed positive returns two years running, and it showed the highest aggregate ROI over the same period.
          
 ##Summary
  ##ReFactoring Code
  
  ##Results of refacored code
  Images below include the performance screens of the original and refactored code.

   ##The advantages to re-factoring code
One of the obvious advantages to refactoring code is that it can improve the performance of the code, as seen in the above linked images. It also has the outcome of cleaning up the code, making it simpler to read and implement. However refactoring does have some disadvantages, the first being the time needed to go back and clean up the code, although cleaning up the code is a good best practice it would have to be weighed against the size and complexity of the code as well as how much you would gain in viewabilty and performance. Two hours work may not be reasonable if you only gain a seconds better performance. The other disadvantage to refactoring is the possibility to break working code, and thus increase the time needed to fix.
In the specific case of the code we refactored in this analysis we gained about a second roughly in the performance of the code, but we also cleaned up the code to make it a little easier to read. I would say if there were any disadvantage it was the time put in to re-factor the code for the limited results. Obviously in a learning environment the advantage of this exercise is paramount, however if the question is what is the disadvantage of refactoring this code in any other sitaution I believe I would say it was the low ROI of time to outcomes.
