#**Stock_Analysis**
## Project Overview
 The purpose of this analysis was to look at multiple stock qoutes over a two year range to determing if we could find which companies showed the best upward trends for our client to make an informed decision. We would utilize the stock prices for 12 companies over a two year period, this would include the clients initial stock pick for Daqo holdings(DQ). 
  ## Analysis Process  
     To find out which company had the best returns for each of the two years we utilzed data from 12 different companies for the fiscal years of 2017 and 2018. We made sure to include the daily total volume for each account, the stocks opening price, high for the day, and the closing price. 
    ### Results
       Looking through the years 2017 and 2018 we see a couple different patterns.
       ## 2017 Results

          As we can see in 2017 everyone but TERP had a year of positive returns. However there were four companies that stood well ahead of the rest in overall percentage of return. DQ, SEDG, ENPH, and FSLR all ended the year with over a 100% return on investment. 
       ## 2018 Results
          ![2018_outcomes_image](https://github.com/Bren42/Stock_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/All_Stocks_analysis_2018%20Outcomes.png)
          In 2018 we saw a very different picture, most of our companies saw a loss on their stock price that year. ENPH and RUN however both showed significant positive returns for this year.
       ## Overall results
          Based on the outcomes of each year, and when looking at each stock in the cumulative, ENPH would be your best stock to pick based on data and other factors presented to us. It was one of only two companies that showed positive returns two years running, and it showed the highest aggregate ROI over the same period.
